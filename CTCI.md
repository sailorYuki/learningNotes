# Cracking The Coding Interview

## resume
- Resumer Screeners look for smartness and coding ability.
- Writing Strong Bullets: accomplished  X by implementing Y which led Z.
- Projects(2 - 4): what it is? languages and technology, an individual or a team, independnet or course project.
- List most used languages and experience level :java(proficient),JS(prior exprience).
- Non English Speaker: proofread resume. (work authorization/visa status).
## interview
- Most challenging; what you learned; most interesting;hardest bug;enjoyed most;conflicts with teammates(Projects).
- Weakness(A real weakness:prefectionist isn`t ok);most challenging(learning many languages and tecknologies isn`t ok).
- What questions should you ask interviews:
  - How much everyday do you spend coding?
  - How many meetings do you have every week?
  - What is the ratio of testers to developers to product manageres?
  - How does project planning happen on the team?
  - I noticed that you use tecnology X, how do you handle problem Y?
  - Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol? I know it has benefits not to use it because of issue D?
  - I`m interested in X, did you come in with a background in this, or what opportunities are there to learn about it.
  - I`m not familiar with technology X, but it sounds likes a very interesting solution, Could you tell me a bit more about how it works?
## How to prepare for technical questions
- Try to solve problems on your own.
- Write the code for algorithms on paper.
- Type your code as-is into computer.
- Do mock interview.
- Absolute must-have knowldge :
  - Data structures : Linked List; Binary Trees; Tries; Stacks; Queues; Vectors/ArrayLists; Hash Tables;
  - Algorithms : Breadth First Search; Depth First Search; Binary Search; Merge Sort; Quick Sort; Tree Insert/Find/etc;
  - Concepts : Bit Manipulation; Singleton Design Pattern; Factory Design Pattern; Memory(Stack vs Heap); Recursion; Big-O Time;
- Five steps to answer tecnical questions:
  - Using own words to ask interviewers and resolve ambiguity(numers,characters,strings,negative numbers,integers, how many....);
  - Design an Algorithm(space and time complexities,what is lot of data,if will case issues);
  - Write pseudo-code first and tell your interviewer that you`re writing pseudo-code;
  - Write code in compurter not to fast and not to slow;
  - test code;
