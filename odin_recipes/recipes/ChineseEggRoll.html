    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>These Chinese egg rolls come from my mom who is the
        best cook ever — and I am a picky eater. If I
        like this, then you will. This is very authentic
        because my family is Chinese and I am too. This
        recipe is at least 300 years old in the Ling family.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided</li>

        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>

        <li>1 medium head cabbage, finely shredded</li>

        <li>½ carrot, julienned</li>

        <li>1 pound Chinese barbequed or roasted pork, cut into matchsticks</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) can shredded bamboo shoots</li>

        <li>1 cup dried, shredded wood ear mushroom, rehydrated</li>

        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>2 ½ teaspoons soy sauce</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)</li>

        <li>1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers</li>

        <li>1 egg white, beaten</li>

        <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs and cook,
            without
            stirring, until firmed up. Flip eggs over and cook for an additional 20 seconds to firm the other side. Set
            egg
            pancake aside to cool, then slice into thin strips.</li>

        <li>Heat remaining vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in cabbage and carrot; cook for
            2
            minutes to wilt. Add pork, bamboo shoots, mushroom, green onions, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and MSG; continue
            cooking until vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced egg, then spread the mixture out onto a
            pan,
            and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.</li>

        <li>To assemble the egg rolls: Place a wrapper onto your work surface with one corner pointing towards you.
            Place
            about 3 tablespoons of cooled filling in a heap onto the bottom third of the wrapper. Brush a little beaten
            egg
            white onto the top two edges of the wrapper, then fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll firmly to
            the
            halfway point. Fold the left and right sides snugly over the egg roll, then continue rolling until the top
            corners seal the egg roll with the egg white. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, covering finished egg
            rolls with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.</li>

        <li>Heat about 6 inches of oil in a wok or deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Fry egg rolls 3 or 4 at a time until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels.</li>

    </ol>
