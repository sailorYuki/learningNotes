    <p>This easy poke recipe is a refreshing Hawaiian salad of fresh ahi tuna steak cubes
        tossed with soy sauce, sesame oil, and green onions for a
        dish full of umami flavor. I like to add chopped
        macadamia nuts even though they are not authentic — they
        add a delicious crunch! This makes 4 main course servings
        or 8 appetizer servings.</p>

    <p>These Chinese egg rolls come from my mom who is the
        best cook ever — and I am a picky eater. If I
        like this, then you will. This is very authentic
        because my family is Chinese and I am too. This
        recipe is at least 300 years old in the Ling family.</p>

    <p>This guacamole recipe gets a tasty kick from cayenne and
        cilantro. You can serve it smooth or chunky depending on
        your tastes.</p>
